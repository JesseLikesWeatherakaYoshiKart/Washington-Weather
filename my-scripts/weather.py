#This is a script I learned in a python course! I am excited! 12-7-23 9:19 AM, I wrote my first python code in the terminal.

weather=input ("What is the current weather observation?")
print ("You Observed,", weather)

temp=input ("What is the current temperature?")
print ("You Observed,", temp)

location=input ("Your Location?")
print ("Your Location is,", location)


print ("Your Full Observation: The Location is", location, "and you observed..", weather, "and the temperature is", temp)

print ("If you like this code, check out my other scripts on github! My Username is JesseLikesWeather :)")

#I wrote the temperature input script just 4 minutes later.
